## Understanding DarkRP

DarkRP - a game mode for the popular game Garry's Mod with the idea of a simulation of urban life.
You could rob people, make a business or perhaps become a police officer to protect the town from outlaws.
You could open a gun shop or a pizzeria where you sell the most delicious food in town.
Or you can become the mayor and manage the city, namely the police, urban economies and licensing people.
